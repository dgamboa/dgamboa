# Full Stack Engineer
Hello, I'm Daniel :wave:. I've spent the last few years working and leading multi-disciplinary teams in strategic finance. I used to program on the side for fun but I flipped my schedule in early 2021. I now spend most of my time programming while working on strategic finance projects on the side. I think these two interests will merge at some point for compounding fun :rocket:

## Now
* Professionalizing my software engineering skills at [Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/)
* Actively looking for software engineering roles (i.e. I code, I interview, I eat, I sleep... I repeat)
* Training for and racing in long-distance triathlons (next major race: [Ironman Texas](https://www.ironman.com/im-texas))
* Currently Living: Texas with my wife and kids
* Currently Learning: internet infrastructure systems and crypto-economics

## Side Projects
[rocketree.com](https://rocketree.com): a Wordpress site where [Matt Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgharris34/) and I write about our learnings about learning.

[Lambda Cards](http://lambdacards.com): a flashcards app to study for the Lambda School web core interview.

[Food Trucks API](https://github.com/dgamboa/foodtrucks-backend): a RESTful API with authentication functionality for users to find and explore food trucks, their menus and their ratings.

[NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://nasa-apod-site.netlify.app/): a simple app leveraging [NASA's API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to display the astronomy picture of the day.
