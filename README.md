# Focused on Strategic Finance and Web Development
Hi there, my name is Daniel Gamboa and I've spent the last few years developing my skills around strategic finance and project management. I used to code on the side for fun but, in a bid to have more fun recently, I've flipped my schedule. I'm now spending most of my time coding while working on strategic finance projects on the side. I think these two interests will merge at some point for compounding fun. 

## Side Projects
Check out [rocketree.com](https://rocketree.com), a Wordpress site where Matt Harris and I write about our learnings about learning.

Check out [Lambda Cards](http://lambdacards.com), a simple flashcards app to study for the Lambda School web core interview.

Check out the [Food Trucks API](https://github.com/dgamboa/foodtrucks-backend), a RESTful API with authentication functionality for users to find and explore food trucks, their menus and their ratings.

Check out [nasa-apod-site](https://nasa-apod-site.netlify.app/), a simple app leveraging NASA's API to display the astronomy picture of the day.
